<h2>Stack</h2>

<h4>CRUD 2:</h4>

* PostgresSQL
* PHP
* Laravel
* Blade
* Vue.js


<h2>Project Requirements</h2>

<h4>How the 'only crud' project works</h4>

*"Using the defined stack, create a product CRUD respecting the following rules"*

**Each product must have:**

* Identification code
* Name
* Price

**In the application, the user should be able to:**

* Add a new product
* Edit an existing product
* Delete an existing product
* View all registered products in a table or list

**Not allowed:**

* Repeating technologies used in the previous stack (except HTML, CSS, and JS)
* Using any kind of code generated by AI and the like

**Allowed:**

* Consulting the documentation of the technology you are using
* Consulting forums, as long as you don't copy code directly without understanding what it does

**The entire development process must be documented:**
* The entire development process must be recorded live
* The application must be made live

<h2>Project Setup</h2>
<h3>‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites</h3>

To run the application, make sure you have the following installed:

* PHP 8.2.12
* Composer 2.6.6
* Npm 10.2.3

<h3>Server</h3>

Clone this repository and navigate to the '/server' folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/only-crud-organization/crud-2.git
```

```bash
    cd server
```

After cloning the repository, install dependencies using Composer:
```bash
    composer install
```

Before starting the project, make sure to configure your environment: Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and adjust the settings, including the database credentials (in my case, I configured it for postgres, but you can use any database you prefer)

```env
    DB_CONNECTION=YOUR_DB
    DB_HOST=YOUR_HOST
    DB_PORT=YOUR_PORT
    DB_DATABASE=YOUR_DB
    DB_USERNAME=YOUR_USERNAME
    DB_PASSWORD=YOUR_DB_PASSWORD

```

Then, run the migrations to create tables in the database, using:

```bash
    php artisan migrate
```

Next, to test the backend of the application or start the server, use:

```bash
    php artisan serve
```

<h3>Client</h3>
Navigate to the '/client' folder:

```bash
    cd client
```

Install dependencies using `npm` or `yarn`:
```bash
    npm i
```

<h2>How to Run</h1>

Finally, **after starting the server**, test the application with the command line:

```bash
    npm run dev
```
